# Pebble Remind Me

Create reminders on your Pebble watch the easiest possible way.

## Idea

Dumb, repetitive and mechanical tasks (doing the dishes, taking a shower, driving to work, jogging, what-have-you) are always a good opportunity for my mind to wander, and often the times ideas spouts and *to-do*'s come back to mind. When those ideas come up, my usual way to treat them is to postpone them to after the task at hands, as I'm probably not in a position to take notes (hands are wet, or on the wheel, etc.).
Unfortunately, most of the times I fail to remember the idea when I get in better disposition to write it down, or to process it.

**Remind Me** is my solution to this problem. My own digital way to tie a knot to my handkerchief, to tie a string around my index finger, or to throw a slipper, a book, or any other unusual item in the middle of the room's floor, always on my wrist.

## How it works

The main postulate is that often, I don't need to be reminded of what was the idea, I just need to be reminded I had it a short time ago, and the idea will easily resurface. The very first version of **Remind Me** will allow just this: define an "empty" reminder that will notify me in 10 minutes, probably a time when I can act on the idea (write it down, do it, etc.).
